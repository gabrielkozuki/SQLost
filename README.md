# SQLost
SQLost is an educational game created to assist in the teaching and learning process of database content through the Structured Query Language (SQL). This project is a result of the Final Course Project presented to the Higher Education Course in Analysis and Development of Systems at the Federal Institute of Paran√° - Londrina Campus.

Made with React.js and the SQL.js library to run SQL relational database queries entirely in the browser. The game is currently only playable in pt-BR and the translation to en-US will begin soon.
